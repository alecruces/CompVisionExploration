# Exploring Computer Vision: From Image Processing to Deep Learning
---

##  Description 

This project delves into computer vision and deep learning for image tasks. Utilizing tools such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, image pre-processing, filtering, and transformation techniques are implemented. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is used for feature matching, and bag-of-visual-words for image classification. The project also involves experimentation with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to tackle intricate image tasks.
